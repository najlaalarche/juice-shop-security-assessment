# Methodology

This security assessment was performed using a manual and observational approach.

## Steps Followed
1. Explored the application as a normal user to understand its functionality
2. Identified user input points such as search fields and forms
3. Used browser developer tools to inspect network requests and responses
4. Observed how user input is processed and reflected by the application
5. Documented potential security risks based on observed behavior

## Approach
- No automated tools were used
- No destructive actions were performed
- The focus was on understanding application behavior rather than exploitation
